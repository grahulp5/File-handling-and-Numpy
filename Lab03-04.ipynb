    "The __data__ folder contains five csv files with column names `Col_A`, `Col_B`, `Col_C`, `Col_D`, and `Col_E`, as well as some fictitious data. Write Python code that extracts all the lines from each file (except the first line which contains the columns names) and creates a list of those integers for each file. For example, the list of integers for the file `Y2015-data.csv` would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].\n",

The value for the key (e.g. `Y2015`) should be the list of integers extracted from that file (i.e. `Y2015-data.csv`). You can write all of the above mentioned code in a single cell.\n",
